Welcome! Answer all these questions.

Do you want a text OCR-ed? If yes continue below. If not, clear all this text and type your issue.

* Has the text already been OCR-ed? Have you searched online (using both devanAgarI and latin transliterations)?
  * For example in the large repositories of digitized texts listed [here](https://sites.google.com/site/samskrtamsfo/home/prakashanani/pathyam#TOC---Digitized-texts).
* What factors should our OCR/ other volunteers consider when deciding whether to take up this request? In other words, what's so important about this text?
* Are you willing to proofread the OCR-ed text? See [here](https://sites.google.com/site/sanskritcode/ocr/3-corrections) to get an idea of what it involves.
* Provide a link to the pdf of the *printed* book which needs to be OCR-ed. You can host the pdf online on several sites such as <dropbox.com> or <sites.google.com> .
* Is there any other information you want to provide?
